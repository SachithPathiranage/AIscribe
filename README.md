## Optimizing Gemini API Results

To get the most accurate results from Gemini when analyzing images and videos:

### For Images:
1. **Image Quality**: Higher resolution images generally yield better results. If possible, use images that are at least 640x480 pixels.

2. **Image Format**: JPEG or PNG formats work best. Avoid highly compressed images that might have artifacts.

3. **Image Content**: Ensure the image is well-lit and in focus. Gemini performs better on clear images without blur or excessive noise.

4. **Complex Content**: For images with multiple objects or complex scenes, you can enable the "Detailed Analysis" option to get a more comprehensive breakdown.

### For Videos:
1. **Video Length**: Keep videos under 5 minutes for optimal analysis. Longer videos may be processed but with less detail.

2. **Video Resolution**: Higher resolution videos (720p or better) provide more information for the model to analyze.

3. **Key Moments**: The system automatically extracts strategic frames from different parts of the video, focusing on scene changes, but you can also manually specify timestamps if you want analysis of specific moments.

4. **Audio Track**: If your video has clear speech, enable transcription to get a more complete understanding of the content.

### General Tips:
1. **API Key**: Ensure your Gemini API key has adequate quota and permissions.

2. **Temperature Setting**: The application uses a low temperature setting (0.2) for more focused and accurate analysis. You can adjust this in the config if needed.

3. **Retries**: The system automatically retries API calls if they fail, but for very complex content, you may need to run the analysis multiple times.

4. **Preprocessing**: The application automatically preprocesses images by resizing, enhancing contrast, and improving sharpness to optimize for Gemini's analysis.
